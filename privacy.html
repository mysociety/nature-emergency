        <h2>What is this webpage?</h2>

        <p>The Woodland Trust has undertaken a project to collect and display data on Nature
        Emergency Declarations in the UK. The Woodland Trust collaborated with both Climate
        Emergency UK (EC UK) and mySociety on this project.</p>

        <p>The Woodland Trust made a grant to mySociety to produce this webpage which will
        display the data on Nature Emergency Declarations collected by CE UK.</p>

        <p>This publicly accessible website presents the local authority nature emergency
        declaration data collected by Climate Emergency UK in a way that gives users the key
        information they need to push for stronger action on nature recovery. The primary aim is
        for more local authorities to declare a nature emergency and set out a clear response to
        address it. This a Woodland Trust project, although other Environmental None
        Government Organisations have been consulted in its development.</p>
