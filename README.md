# Nature Emergency Declarations

## Use it online

Visit <https://mysociety.github.io/nature-emergency>.

All modern browsers are supported. Internet Explorer is not. See `.browserlistrc` for details.

## Running locally

Requirements:

- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)
- [Bundler](https://bundler.io/#getting-started)

Install all dependencies and get a local server running immediately, in one command:

    script/server

The site will be available at both <http://localhost:4000> and <http://0.0.0.0:4000>.

If you want to serve locally over SSL (recommended) then generate self-signed SSL certificates with:

    script/generate-ssl-certificates

Once the SSL certificates are in place, `script/server` will serve the site over HTTPS, at both <https://localhost:4000> and <https://0.0.0.0:4000>. (You will need to tell your web browser to accept the self-signed certificate.)

You can build the site to `_site` (without serving it) with:

    script/build

## Generating data

Data is generated by two Python scripts in `script/`. Before running them, you’ll need to install their dependencies, eg:

    python3 -m venv .venv
    . .venv/bin/activate
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
    shot-scraper install

### Nature Emergency Declarations (councils.csv)

You can then re-generate `_data/councils.csv` by running `script/generate-councils` over a HTML export of the spreadsheet collated by Climate Emergency UK, eg:

    script/generate-councils --in path/to/google/sheet.html

### Social sharing images

Whenever you (re-)generate `_data/councils.csv` you will also want to regenerate all of the social sharing preview images (this takes around 3½ minutes to run, 2 councils per second):

    script/generate-social-previews --start-server

The `--start-server` flag tells `script/generate-social-previews` to run its own internal server at 0.0.0.0:4000 so you’ll want to make sure that port is available for it to use. If not, you can run a server separately, and tell the script where to find it. See `script/generate-social-previews --help` for documentation on how to override the default server address, CSV input path, and image output path, for example, to make it generate images for only a subset of councils:

    script/generate-social-previews --start-server --input /path/to/shorter-list-of-councils.csv

You will likely also want to compress the PNGs once they’ve been generated (eg: pngquant, at 80% quality, and Zopfli results in a ~65% filesize saving).

### Tip: Comparing changes to councils.csv

When regenerating `_data/councils.csv` it can sometimes be useful to see what’s changed. The [`csv-diff` Python program](https://pypi.org/project/csv-diff/) is included in `dev-requirements.txt` for this reason.

If you’ve not yet overwritten `_data/councils.csv`, you can supply the `--out` parameter to `script/generate-councils` to tell it to generate the new councils to a separate file, and then tell `csv-diff` to compare the two files:

    script/generate-councils --in path/to/google/sheet.html --out _data/councils-new.csv
    csv-diff _data/councils.csv _data/councils-new.csv --key=council_name

Or, if you’ve already overwritten `_data/councils.csv` (but not yet committed the change), you can pull an unmodified version of the file out of the Git history, and compare that with the current state:

    git show HEAD:_data/councils.csv > _data/councils-old.csv
    csv-diff _data/councils-old.csv _data/councils.csv --key=council_name

### Council similarity data (similarities.csv)

`_data/similarities.csv` is a simplified version of mySociety’s [Local Authority Composite Similarity dataset](https://pages.mysociety.org/local-authority-similarity/datasets/composite_distance/latest), with GSS codes replacing three-letter-codes, and only the _most_ similar “B” councils included for each “A” council. It was generated by `script/generate-similarities`, eg:

    script/generate-similarities --out _data/similarities.csv
