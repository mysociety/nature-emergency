# Nature Emergency Declarations

## Use it online

Visit <https://mysociety.github.io/nature-emergency>.

All modern browsers are supported. Internet Explorer is not. See `.browserlistrc` for details.

## Running locally

Requirements:

- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)
- [Bundler](https://bundler.io/#getting-started)

Install all dependencies and get a local server running immediately, in one command:

    script/server

The site will be available at both <http://localhost:4000> and <http://0.0.0.0:4000>.

If you want to serve locally over SSL (recommended) then generate self-signed SSL certificates with:

    script/generate-ssl-certificates

Once the SSL certificates are in place, `script/server` will serve the site over HTTPS, at both <https://localhost:4000> and <https://0.0.0.0:4000>. (You will need to tell your web browser to accept the self-signed certificate.)

You can build the site to `_site` (without serving it) with:

    script/build

## Generating data

`_data/councils.csv` is generated by running `script/generate-data` over a HTML export of the spreadsheet collated by Climate Emergency UK. `script/generate-data` is a Python script, so youâ€™ll need to install its dependencies (in a virtualenv) before running it, eg:

    python3 -m venv .venv
    . .venv/bin/activate
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
    script/generate-data --in path/to/google/sheet.html --out _data/councils.csv
