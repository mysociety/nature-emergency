Producing the Ecological Emergency Response Plan will involve conducting a fully detailed cross service review to identify actions (with associated costs) and targets to be undertaken by DCC with relevant partners (a similar process was undertaken in relation to the development of the Climate Emergency Response Plan (CERP)).(b) That the Ecological Emergency Response Plan is a standalone plan initially, and then over time as it develops, is merged with the Climate Emergency Response Plan.(c) To progress the development of the plan, Cabinet ensures that best ecological practice is integrated across all Council services and in doing so considers the inclusion of ecology in the implications sheet that accompanies all DCC committee reports.(d) When declaring an ecological emergency, the need for engagement and consultation should be articulated and request that the Corporate Director of Neighbourhoods and Climate Change:i. Raise awareness of biodiversity decline in County Durham and promote various educational activities undertaken by DCC, partners and community groups to tackle this issue.ii. Ensure engagement with community and special interest groups and interested individuals, as part of any consultation arrangements and in relation to the future development and delivery of the action plan.(e) That the Environment and Sustainable Communities Overview and Scrutiny Committee receives regular updates on the progression of the plan and once developed, monitors progress against the actions and targets contained in the plan, on a regular basis.(f) That the review of the progress made against the recommendations contained in this report will be undertaken six months after the report is considered by Cabinet.""",1,1,0

With 41 per cent of wild species in decline nationally, and 15 per cent facing extinction. The requirement to take action to reverse this is urgent. We recognise that: A) Nature provides us with vital support systems ['ecosystem services'], and severe declines in biodiversity are undermining nature's productivity and adaptability, posing excessive uncertainty for our economies and wellbeing; B) A thriving natural environment underpins a healthy, happy, prosperous society; C) The impacts of climate change are driving nature's decline, while restoring and protection of natural habitat provides a wide variety of cost-effective benefits to mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change. D) Many areas of work of local authorities across the county of Staffordshire have an impact on nature, and we have responsibilities to make decisions to protect and enhance it. In order to support the recovery of nature across Staffordshire, and in recognition of new obligations under the Environment Act 2021 , this council commits to: 1 . work with partners and stakeholders to develop and deliver a Local Nature Recovery Strategy (LNRS) that sits within the national Nature Recovery Network and underpins planning, development and land management decisions. As part of this, we will: a) improve and protect the landscape and flora and fauna's resilience to climate change, providing natural solutions to reduce carbon and manage flood risk, and sustaining vital ecosystems; b) prioritise the restoration of peatland habitats and other high quality natural habitats, and adopt a peat-free policy wherever possible for all council contracts and supplies; c) formulate a tree policy and strategy which is underpinned by Nature Recovery Network mapping across the local authority area, pursuing a ""right tree, right place"" approach; d) after satisfying safety and visibility priorities and the Highway Code, develop verge cutting regimes that maximise potential for carbon storage, sequestration and biodiversity; e) seek to manage council-owned land for the benefit of wildlife by 2030 (in line with UK Government's national and international commitments); f) meet the Environment Act requirement of 10% biodiversity net-gain commitment across all council-owned land, aspiring to increase this wherever possible; g) carry out a carbon audit of our key landholdings to establish how carbon storage/sequestration could be improved. 2. Embed nature's recovery into all strategic plans and policy areas, not just those directly related to the environment. Ensure the LNRS is well understood across the authority and complements other relevant plans and strategies. 3. Working with partners, demonstrate leadership by supporting and engaging with businesses, communities and the wider public to take action to put nature into recovery. 4. Build tackling the nature crisis into Cabinet's environmental portfolio to provide a designated lead. 5. The Council designates a lead officer to coordinate the council operations in relation to the ecological emergency. 6. Integrate the targets, objectives and outcomes of this motion with those outlined in the existing Climate Emergency Declaration to ensure measures to tackle climate issues do not contravene the principles of enhancing biodiversity. 7. Where appropriate, the council will invest in nature-based solutions to climate change in order to tackle the nature crisis and climate emergency together. 8. Through the LNRS, develop an evidence-based action plan including short and long-term targets for putting nature into recovery by 2030. Areas of focus will include: Land management; Biodiversity; Roads and highways; Planning and development; Air quality; Transforming urban spaces; Health and wellbeing; People and communities; Education and awareness. 9. That the relevant Overview and Scrutiny Committee monitor the LNRS and ESBC's action to support biodiversity and nature recovery on an annual basis. 10.

This crisis has already resulted in a global surface temperature rise of 1.1ºC, affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe, leading to widespread adverse impacts and related losses, including damage to nature and people.We welcome the recent statement on the climate emergency and biodiversity crisis from our new council leader that “taking real action to combat these will not only be an immediate priority but will also be an ever-present consideration in all that we do throughout this term and beyond”.In response to this rallying call, this Council accepts the inadequacy of the climate related motion it passed in June 2019 and, leading by example, will significantly increase the rate of carbon reduction associated with its own corporate plan to achieve carbon neutrality for its direct emissions by 2030 and indirect emissions by 2050.Recognising the delay that has already occurred in encouraging meaningful carbon reductions across the District (to achieve District-wide Carbon Net Zero by 2050), this Council wishes to see the draft Climate Action Strategy (approved by Cabinet on 24 March 2023) subjected to meaningful community engagement forthwith, along with the rapid development of an appropriate and proportionate action plan to engage, activate and support residents in this joint quest.""",0,0,0

Apply and implement the new Local Nature Recovery Strategy (LNRS) that will sit within the national Nature Recovery Network and ensure it underpins all planning, development, and land management decisions, including the Local Plan.  As part of this, the council will: • In line with the LNRS, use the council’s habitat/Nature Recovery Network map to prioritise sites within the ecological network to provide a strategic base for the creation of a Nature Recovery Network. • Use the council’s habitat/Nature Recovery Network map to inform the selection of biodiversity net gain projects within the region. • Increase space for wildlife and commit to the long-term maintenance and expansion of a Nature Recovery Network. • Seek to manage at least 30% of council-owned land for the benefit of wildlife by 2030 (in line with UK Government’s national and international commitments). • Maintain a commitment to achieve a net-gain to biodiversity across all development, meeting the Environment Act requirement of 10% biodiversity net-gain, and 20% above the biodiversity unit value of habitats lost using the Lichfield District ‘replacement percentage’. • Improve the landscape’s resilience to climate change, employing nature-based solutions to mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change on the District, including carbon storage and sequestration, managing flood risk, improving water quality, and sustaining vital ecosystems. • Formulate a tree strategy which is underpinned by Nature Recovery Network mapping across the local authority area, pursuing a “right tree, right place” approach. • After satisfying safety and visibility priorities, develop greenspace cutting regimes to maximise potential for biodiversity, carbon storage and sequestration. • Carry out a carbon audit of local authority sites to establish how carbon storage/sequestration could be improved. • Prioritise the protection of heathland habitats, focussing on restoration and increasing ecological connectivity. • Adopting a peat-free policy for all council contracts and supplies. • Aim to achieve favourable condition on all council-managed protected and designated nature sites (e.g., SSSIs (Site of Special Scientific Interest), LNRs (Local Nature Reserves), LWSs (Local Wildlife Sites)) by 2030. • Continue to support the Transforming the Trent Valley Landscape Partnership, seeking ways to continue its work and secure its legacy.  People, health, and wellbeing 2. Improve access to nature by following the Natural England ‘Nature Nearby’ Accessible Natural Greenspace Guidance1. Regard will be given to:  • Areas with high levels of physical health problems. • Areas with high levels of mental health problems. • Areas where the amount and quality of accessible natural greenspace is below Natural England’s targets.  3. Demonstrate leadership by supporting and educating businesses, communities and the wider public to take action to put nature into recovery.  Strategic planning and development 4. Develop a biodiversity evidence-based strategy and action plan, as part of the upcoming wider 2050 Lichfield District Strategy, which includes short and long-term targets to reverse the decline of nature and increase species abundance by 2030. Publish interim reports on the progress made with regards to the above-mentioned action plan. This should complement the Local Nature Recovery Strategy.  5. Embed nature’s recovery into all strategic plans, including the Local Plan, and all policy areas, not just those directly related to the environment. Ensure the LNRS is well understood across the authority and complements other relevant plans and strategies.  6. Integrate the targets, objectives, and outcomes of this motion, i.e., the biodiversity strategy and action plan, with those outlined in the upcoming wider 2050 Lichfield District Strategy and Organisational Carbon Reduction Plan, to ensure measures to tackle climate issues do not contravene the principles of enhancing biodiversity. Wherever possible, the council will invest in nature-based solutions to climate change to tackle the nature crisis and climate emergency together.  7. Provide training and resources for councillors and council employees about the ecological emergency.  8. Ensure monitoring occurs to focus on achieving the targets and objectives outlined in this declaration. Working and sharing results with; cross-party representatives, council staff and relevant experts from external organisations. Monitoring progress and identifying opportunities for improvement to report back to the Council, and reporting progress alongside the requirements of the Environment Act through the production of a ‘Biodiversity Report’ every five years.  9. Issue a declaration of compatibility alongside all future council motions and policy to ensure that any conflicts with nature’s recovery are made apparent.  10. Appoint a member of the Cabinet as the designated lead for tackling the nature crisis.  11. Appoint a council employee as the designated lead for coordinating council operations in relation to the ecological emergency.""",1,1,1

The report confirms that limiting global warming to 1.5°C is needed and may still be possible with ambitious action from national and sub-national authorities and others to cut carbon emissions dramatically in the years before 2030.This Council recognises that the climate and ecological emergency will impact on the whole world, but its worst effects will be felt in countries that are among the poorest and least able to adapt. This includes, but is by no means limited to, Bangladesh and Somalia, countries with which Camden has strong links. Fighting climate change is therefore a matter of international social justice as well as of environmental concern.Given this, Camden Council welcomes the work of the Camden’s Citizens’ Assembly on the climate and ecological crisis held this summer. It extends its thanks to the citizens for their time and energy participating in the assembly.This Council will commit new resources in order to develop the assembly’s proposals into a Climate Action Plan for Camden that will define our response to what is now a climate and ecological emergency.This Council recalls the importance attached to cutting carbon dioxide emissions in Camden since at least 2010, when it appointed Camden’s first ever cabinet member for sustainability and adopted Camden’s 10-year Green Action for Change programme.The Council further recalls the extent and range of its overall work, including:- the creation of the Camden Climate Change Alliance business network in 2008 which is still thriving and is now open to schools;- the establishment of Somers Town Energy, which supplies low-carbon heating to over 500 council homes and a local school and also generates low-carbon electricity;- the adoption of the highest sustainability standards for new buildings in Camden, including in the council’s own projects;- the creation of the Camden Climate Fund, which allows local people and organisations to apply for funds to cut carbon in their homes and offices;- the recent schools ‘Sustainers’ group, who are challenging the Council, Camden schools, and other organisations to go further and faster.This Council notes that during the Green Action for Change period Camden’s borough-wide Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions (from heating and powering buildings, and road transport in Camden) have reduced by 38% since 2010 and are on track to reach our 40% reduction target by 2020. Given the status of the emergency, this Council agrees with the need for a stronger target to support national carbon reduction and help to avoid climate breakdown. We also acknowledge the need to work with our citizens to reduce Camden’s Scope 3 (indirect) emissions which can be reduced significantly by informed consumer choice and business supply chain improvements.This Council therefore acknowledges that the scale of the current emergency, and the urgent need to make sure we stay below 1.5 degrees of warming globally, means we need to go further and faster in the next 12 years.This Council formally:a) declares a climate and ecological emergency;b) commits the Council to take the action it can to make Camden net zero carbon by 2030, taking forward the recommendations[1] of the Camden Climate Emergency Citizens’ Assembly to achieve this, ensuring that Camden’s citizens, businesses, and local organisations are fully involved in the mission to reduce carbon, and pursuing climate action measures with energy and dedication;c) commits the Council to tell the truth to Camden citizens about the scale and seriousness of the emergency;d) commits the Council to press the Government to take as much action as it can and for it to be similarly upfront about the extent of the emergency;e) commits to produce a new ecological plan for Camden to sustain and improve biodiversity in Camden;f) encourages all citizens, businesses, and organisations or groups in the borough of Camden to join with the Council to cut carbon, and to protect and improve biodiversity, in order to avert impending catastrophe.""[1] *Recommendations of the Camden Citizens’ Assembly on the Climate and Ecological EmergencyHome• Encouraging low-carbon dietary choices.• Making all new homes ‘zero carbon’.• Creating more green space on residential streets.• Fitting solar panels on as many homes as possible.• Campaigning to make CO2 reduction fun.Neighbourhood• Planting more trees and creating more allotments.• Piloting a community energy heating scheme.• Installing more ‘segregated’ cycle lanes.• Promoting and trialling car free zones and days.• Enabling electric transport with infrastructure and incentives.• Developers to fund energy efficiency retrofits of old buildings.Council• Establishing a Climate Emergency scrutiny panel made up of experts and residents.• All council properties to be fossil-fuel free.• Planting trees and retaining public spaces.• Improving council communications and engagement on the climate crisis.• Mobilising existing community groups to work on tackling the climate crisis.• Greening the Council’s operations.",1,0,0

That the findings of the Global Biodiversity Outlook, produced by the Convention on Biological Diversity, be noted, in particular:That biodiversity is declining at an unprecedented rate, and the pressures driving this decline are intensifying.None of the Aichi Biodiversity Targets will be fully met, in turn threatening the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals and undermining efforts to address climate change.The COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted the importance of the relationship between people and nature, and it reminds us all of the profound consequences to our own well-being and survival that can result from continued biodiversity loss and the degradation of ecosystems.Reports provided by the world’s governments, as well as other sources of evidence, reveal examples of progress which, if scaled up, could support the transformative changes necessary to achieve the 2050 vision of living in harmony with nature.2. That the Salford City Council believes that:The impacts of the continued decline in biodiversity were so severe that Governments at all levels must work together and make this a top priority.As well as improvements in the innate value people place on biodiversity, tackling the decline in biodiversity can deliver wider benefits for the environment, economy and society and that embedding a Natural Capital Approach was essential to realising these.3. That Salford City Council declare a ‘biodiversity emergency’ alongside the climate emergency to support the delivery of the GM 5 Year Environment Plan.4. That the existing Climate Action Board:Monitor progress of indicators of key species diversity and abundance in Salford.Take a mission-based approach to reversing these declines as part of the 5 Year Environment and in line with the findings of the GM Local Nature Recovery Strategy pilot.Consider systematically the biodiversity impact of each area of the council’s activities.Make recommendations and set an ambitious timescale for reducing these impacts in line with the tasks set out in the GM 5 Year Environment Plan.Assess the feasibility of requiring all report risk and procurement assessments to include biodiversity or natural capital appraisals, including presenting alternative approaches which reduce the impact wherever possible.Report to the council every six months on progress and actions required to take to address this emergency and how it will continue to work with GM Districts to implement a Mission Based Approach.5. That it be agreed to task a director level officer with responsibility for tackling the biodiversity impact of the council’s activities.6. That it be agreed to equip staff, particularly those involved with buildings, energy and transport management and procurement of goods and service, with an awareness of the biodiversity and natural capital costs and impacts of everyday activities, and the ability and motivation to reduce these.7. That all organisations, businesses, and citizens can play their part in tackling the biodiversity emergency.8. That it be agreed that the City Mayor be requested to write to the Prime Minister to inform them that Salford City Council has declared a biodiversity emergency, with a request from Government to provide the resources and powers necessary to deal with it.see full text here  under heading Salford’s Biodiversity Emergency Declaration and the Biodiversity Duty - https://www.salford.gov.uk/your-council/climate-change/salford-s-biodiversity-emergency-declaration-and-the-biodiversity-duty/",1,0,0

The Council notes that:1. All levels of government (national, regional, and local) have a responsibility to limitthe negative impacts of climate breakdown. It is important for the residents of WestBerkshire and the UK that we commit to working towards Net Zero as quickly aspossible.2. The consequences of global temperature rising above 1.5°C are so severe thatpreventing this from happening must be of utmost urgency.3. The current rate of habitat degradation and loss of biodiversity within WestBerkshire and the UK is likely to be having a detrimental impact and needs to beprevented.4. Bold climate and ecological action can deliver social and economic benefits interms of new jobs, economic savings, and improved health and wellbeing but willalso require changes in individuals’ lifestyles and have a cost implication to boththe individual and the state.West Berkshire Council therefore: Declares a Climate and Ecological Emergency Will take action to reduce emissions from its operations and activities in order toachieve Net Zero by 2030 Will continue to revise and deliver on our strategic plan for West Berkshire thataims to facilitate and influence the achievement of Net Zero for the District as soonas practicable. Will ensure the ecological emergency is highlighted alongside our climate action tomaximise benefits. Calls on HM Government to provide the Council with the powers and resources tomake the achievement of our Climate and Ecological targets possible. Will work with other authorities and external stakeholders and residents todetermine and implement where practicable to best practice methods to limit globalwarming to less than 1.5°C and to act for nature to protect the environment withinWest Berkshire and beyond.",0,0,0

Recognising the currentstate of nature and our dependence on the natural world in providingcrucial ecosystem services. It is proposed this declaration sit alongsidethe Council’s Climate Emergency (2019) declaration. Given theinterconnectedness of climate change as one of the main factors inbiodiversity loss council agrees there is an urgent need to act in favour ofnature recovery and restoration to help address the issue and meet keytargets.Council is asked to note that there is a large body of evidence highlightingan alarming degree of biodiversity loss throughout the world:x State of Nature Report, Scotland 2019:https://www.nature.scot/doc/state-nature-scotland-report-2019 “theabundance and distribution of Scotland’s species has on averagedeclined over recent decades and most measures indicate thisdecline has continued in the most recent decade.”x WWF Living Planet Report 2022: https://livingplanet.panda.org/enGB/ “global wildlife populations have plummeted by 69% onaverage since 1970”x The PREDICTS (Projecting Responses of Ecological Diversity inChanging Terrestrial Systems) team at the Natural History Museumhas calculated a global Biodiversity Intactness Index (BII) to assesseach area’s biodiversity. A BII of 90% or more means the area hasenough biodiversity to be a resilient and functioning ecosystem.Under 90%, biodiversity loss means ecosystems may function lesswell and less reliably. If the BII is 30% or less, the area'sbiodiversity has been depleted and the ecosystem could be at riskof collapse. The UK has a BII of 53%, which is in the bottom 10percent globally. https://www.nhm.ac.uk/ourscience/data/biodiversity-indicators.htmlCouncil agrees that nature has an intrinsic value to humans, and plays anintegral role in our culture and society, our health, wellbeing, andeconomy, this being demonstrated through literature, music, art,placemaking, green prescribing, scientific research, food, energy, waterregulation, air quality regulation, etc.Nature plays a key role in meeting climate targets, with respect to adaptation, resilience and mitigation.The final decision text at COP 27 recognises the interlinked crises ofclimate change and biodiversity loss, and recognises the “vital importanceof protecting, conserving, restoring and sustainably using nature andecosystems for effective and sustainable climate action”https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/cma2022_L21_revised_adv.pdf.Council notes that the revised national Scottish Biodiversity Strategy(draft) and upcoming Natural Environment Bill will provide statutory targetsfor public bodies, including local authorities, will require them to meet thechallenges of the nature crisis.The Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) agreed atCOP15 in December 2022, presents 23 global biodiversity targets withlong term goals including maintaining, enhancing or restoring “the integrity,connectivity and resilience of all ecosystems, substantially increasing thearea of natural ecosystems by 2050”; and “Biodiversity is sustainably usedand managed and nature’s contributions to people, including ecosystemfunctions and services, are valued, maintained and enhanced, with thosecurrently in decline being restored, supporting the achievement ofsustainable development, for the benefit of present and future generationsby 2050.The key role of subnational governments and local communities inrealising delivery of the GBF over the coming decade is acknowledged inthe Edinburgh Declaration, signed on behalf of West Lothian Council inNov 2021. Council has already committed to addressing the nature crisis throughsigning the Edinburgh Declaration and having established a new Ecologyand Biodiversity Team (in place since Oct 2021). This team is working withcouncil colleagues and external partners to halt biodiversity loss (thenational target is to halt loss by 2030), highlight and prevent wildlife crime,enforce the mitigation hierarchy in development, ensure space for naturethrough updated policies and spatial plans, and enrich biodiversity throughthe protection of species and habitats and through the creation of naturenetworks. A new 10-year Local Biodiversity Action Plan is underway,which we plan to publish at the end of 2023, helping us to attain thenational target of restoring and improving biodiversity (in comparison with1990 levels) by 2045.Council further agrees that in declaring a Nature Emergency shows WestLothian Councils recognition of the current state of nature and its inherentvalue, as well as our continued commitment to aiding in the recovery andrestoration of the natural environment to help realise our climate targets.Council agrees to incorporate the ‘Declaration of Nature Emergency’ intothe workings and reports to the Environment PDSP.”",1,0,0
