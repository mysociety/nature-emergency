            <p>Use our template to create a draft motion for your council to declare a nature emergency. This suggested wording includes the three priority actions we’ve deemed key to stopping the loss of nature.</p>

            <div style="border: 3px solid var(--bs-accent);" class="p-4 my-4 p-lg-5 my-lg-5">
                <p><strong>[Council name]</strong> Council recognises the critical importance of a healthy natural environment to the overall wellbeing and quality of life of our residents, and the pressing need to protect and restore nature.</p>

                <p>The physical and mental health benefits of connecting with nature are scientifically proven and evidence continues to grow. Use of public green space, such as parks and woodland, has increased, particularly since the Covid pandemic, as people recognise these benefits and seek solace, exercise and recreation in nature. Yet reports such as the State of Nature show continued deterioration of many aspects of our natural world.</p>

                <p>In light of the twin crises of climate breakdown and biodiversity loss, <strong>[Council name]</strong> Council hereby resolves to:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Declare a nature emergency and develop a comprehensive plan to address it.</li>
                    <li class="mt-3">Establish a climate and nature advisory committee to guide the cabinet and council officers in addressing these urgent issues.</li>
                    <li class="mt-3">Commit to contributing to national level nature and climate targets and commitments.</o>
                    <li class="mt-3">Include ecological impact assessments alongside climate and sustainability considerations in all committee and council reports.</li>
                    <li class="mt-3">Make nature recovery a top strategic priority in planning policies and design guidelines for new developments. This includes:
                        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-latin;">
                            <li class="mt-3">Identifying suitable areas for habitat restoration, establishing ‘green allocated sites’ and embedding Local Nature Recovery Strategies (LNRS) in local plans and policies.</li>
                            <li class="mt-3">Promoting Biodiversity Net Gain (BNG), extending the minimum requirement from 10% to 20%.</li>
                            <li class="mt-3">Minimising the impact of development on existing natural and semi-natural habitats.</li>
                            <li class="mt-3">Enhancing access to nature-rich green spaces within a 10-minute walk for all residents.</li>
                            <li class="mt-3">Requiring new developments to commit to a minimum of 30% tree canopy cover.</li>
                            <li class="mt-3">Promoting tree equity by increasing tree canopy cover in existing housing estates where it is below the 16% urban average for England.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li class="mt-3">Establish and support community and/or local authority-run tree nurseries, increasing the supply of local saplings.</li>
                    <li class="mt-3">Prioritise the use of council landholdings, including council farms, for habitat creation and restoration, to reach 30% of land managed for nature recovery.</li>
                    <li class="mt-3">Employ a specialist ecologist and tree officer to support nature protection and recovery.</li>
                </ol>

                <p class="mb-0">Finally, <strong>[Council name]</strong> Council urges all stakeholders to come together to protect and restore our natural assets, recognising their intrinsic role in securing a sustainable future for our community.</p>
